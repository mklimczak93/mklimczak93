# Magdalena Klimczak

Hi, I’m Magda – an architect turned web developer. 

For the last 5 years I worked as an architect, both in PL and abroad, on different project phases of various scales and functions, in multi-national teams of specialists of different fields. During that time, I gained experience in not only architectural design, but also in working on complex, multi-level projects that require special amount of attention to detail, creative thinking, negotiations and team-work.

After 5 years I have decided to pursue a career change - I moved back  to PL to learn web dev. Initially, I was using Django, Python and JS (e.g. creating a fitness app with double user interface, allowing for both signing up for and publishing new sport classes). Right now I am focused on bettering my skills of JavaScript and React, building new projects in MERN stack (e.g. wine cellar application for saving one’s favorites wines), but also trying to use my previous experience of design thinking, technical aptitude and finding symbiotic solutions for complex problems in the newly chosen field.
