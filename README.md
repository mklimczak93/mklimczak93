Hi, I’m Magda – an architect turned web developer. 

Originally, I have education and experience in architecture and in this field I have worked for 5 year both in Poland and abroad. I have had the opportunity to work on different project phases, of various scales and functions, in multi-national teams of specialists of different fields (e.g. a whole new quarter in town of Utrecht, with 50,000m2 and 18 buildings of residential, commercial and cultural functions). During that time I gained experience in not only architectural design, but also in working on complex, multi-level projects that require special amount of attention to detail, creative thinking, negotiations and team-work.

After 5 years I have decided to pursue a major change in my career – I moved back to Poland and sacrificed as much time as I could to dive deep into a new field: web development. During that time I have finished two major online courses which were a catalyst for further independent exploration of the field, and brought back the joy of learning I once had. Right now I am pursuing two more courses focusing on bettering my skills of JavaScript and React, but also trying to use my previous experience of design thinking, technical aptitude and finding symbiotic solutions for complex problems in the newly chosen field.
